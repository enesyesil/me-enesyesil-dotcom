Exploring the intersection of computer science and philosophy through Bayes' Theorem, examining how minds and machines process probability and perception.

## My Reflections

### 1. Bayes’ Theorem

I think it is very important to discuss the background of Bayes’ Theorem and its connection to probability. At its core, Bayes’ Theorem revolves around the concept of belief and its spectrum, highlighting how probabilities can represent degrees of belief rather than certainties. This foundation allows for a clear way to quantify and update our understanding of uncertain events.

Belief is not deterministic; rather, it exists on a spectrum of probabilities, representing varying degrees of certainty. This concept is grounded in probability theory, where an event space contains all possible outcomes of a scenario. Each event is assigned a probability value within the range of 0 to 1, where 0 indicates an impossible event and 1 represents absolute certainty. The total sum of probabilities for all possible events within this space equals 1, ensuring a complete representation. Additionally, the negation of an event (its complement) is calculated as `1 − P(event)`.

#### What about the possibilities?

I am not sure if they can be described as "even," but it is clear that the precision of distributed assignments is far from vague. In fact, they are more exact and structured compared to the basic adverbs, offering a clearer way for understanding probabilities.

#### What are the rules?

1. No possibility is measured by 0, and absolute truth is measured by 1. For example, `2 + 2 = 4` is 1.  
2. `p = 1 - q`, where `q` can be referred to as the negation of `p`.  
3. Conjunction and Disjunction: `P + Q` or `P × Q`.

#### What is Bayes’ Theorem?

It is one of the most important theorems in probability theory and has been widely used in statistics.

`P(A|B) = (P(B|A) ⋅ P(A)) / P(B)`

It is especially used in evidence collection to diagnose diseases.

#### What do I think?

It is crucial to grasp the fundamental relationship between the known and unknown properties, as this is at the core of Bayes’ Theorem. Given its extensive application across numerous fields over the years, developing a solid understanding of this theorem is not just valuable but essential. It enables us to bridge gaps in knowledge by systematically updating our beliefs in light of new evidence.

### 2. Philosophical Approach

From what I understand, Bayes’ Theorem combines statistical methodologies with philosophical principles to provide deeper insights into mental perception. By linking probabilities with human reasoning, it offers a framework to understand how we update our beliefs in response to new information.

#### Rabbit or Duck?

This test is a clear way to show how Bayesian reasoning works. While the image itself does not change, a person’s perception—or the reasoning behind their conclusion—can change over time. This illustrates how human thought processes are dynamic, adjusting as new interpretations and context emerge.

An explanation of this phenomenon is that the human mind processes information with other mental states in a complex way.

We can delve deeper into how the human brain utilizes different models of agents, including simple reflex agents, goal-based agents, and learning agents. These models provide a framework for understanding how the brain processes information, responds to stimuli, pursues objectives, and adapts through learning mechanisms.

#### Modular System Characteristics

- **Domain Specificity**: It responds to certain specific inputs.  
- **Information Encapsulation**: It has no external input during the process.

#### Why are these facts so important?

They tell us how the brain works and how processes are carried out. It might explain why, in the absence of certain logic or thoughts, quick perceptions persist, as there is no access to other properties of the brain.

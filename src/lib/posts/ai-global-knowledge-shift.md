For a long time, innovation and deep knowledge were things you kind of had to inherit. If you weren’t born into the right country or didn’t study at the right school, your chances of contributing to global science, research, or art were slim. Power—whether scientific, cultural, or educational—was concentrated. The best tools, minds, and networks were behind paywalls, passports, and institutional walls.

This setup created an uneven intellectual landscape. Some cultures got to shine, while others were stuck watching from the sidelines—not because of lack of talent, but because building intellectual capital was expensive. So a handful of countries led the way, and the rest had to follow.

Then the internet came, and some of those walls started to crack. You could now learn online, join global communities, watch lectures from top schools, maybe even start a company with just a laptop. And yes, it did help close the gap in some ways. It spread ideas faster than anything before. We saw political movements, cultural shifts, and even language itself start to evolve with online influence.

But still, something was missing. The internet gave people access, but not power. It didn’t lead to intellectual leapfrogging. The center of gravity—Silicon Valley, London, Beijing—didn’t really change. Nations may have caught up a little, but they didn’t break through.

Now, in the AI era, that balance is shifting more fundamentally.

What used to be elite is now available to anyone. Large language models, open-source AI, AI tutors, and global research platforms are changing the equation. The barrier to entry is lower than ever. And it’s not just about closing the gap anymore—it’s about skipping steps. In many ways, the idea of the “elite school” advantage is starting to break. Before, the edge was having access to massive knowledge networks, professors, and institutional funding. Now, the edge is simply having access to the right tools and the mindset to use them.

In the past, building an innovation hub took generations—universities, labs, ministries, and years of government investment. Now? Some countries are jumping right over that. India, China, Nigeria—all seeing huge growth in AI research and open-source contributions. Nigeria even ran a pilot where students using an AI tutor learned two years' worth of material in just six weeks. No elite school, no expensive setup—just a chatbot and a cheap device.

And that’s the idea, really. If you’ve got access to the sum of human knowledge through a language model, and you know how to ask the right questions—then who’s stopping you from taking it one step further? All you need is the curiosity, a bit of structure, and the will to push. That’s it.

This leads to what I’d call **generational compression**. People are learning in six months what used to take six years. The curve is shrinking. You no longer need to build expertise over a decade just to enter the field. With the right tools, you can start contributing almost instantly. And it’s not just true for coding or AI—it applies to art, history, science, literature. The doors are open across the board.

It goes even deeper than technical progress, it’s cultural. In the past, nations with strong knowledge institutions had a cultural advantage too. They enriched their languages, developed thought, built narratives. Now, more people in more places are gaining the ability to build, to create, and to influence their own culture. We’re seeing societies grow intellectually faster than ever before.

And it’s not only about preserving what already exists—it’s about creating new forms of cultural expression. If directed right, this shift could benefit every aspect of a society. Literature, art, education, public discourse—AI can become a multiplier for cultural richness, not just economic gain.

Meanwhile, the infrastructure of knowledge itself is transforming—not just for tech, but across every field. Where once journals, research communities, and high-level discussions were locked inside universities or elite circles, today they’re increasingly open. Platforms like arXiv, JSTOR, Substack, YouTube lectures, and even open-access university repositories are becoming part of a much broader global classroom.

If you’re a historian in Tunisia, a sociologist in Colombia, or a literature student in Turkey, you can now read the same preprints, access the same archives, and even publish your own ideas to a global audience. Scholars in fields like philosophy, economics, anthropology, education, and political science are using open tools to share fieldwork, essays, visual materials, and even course content. Artists are uploading their work to global platforms and getting feedback from people across cultures.

What used to be an exclusive network of experts has become a shared commons where people across disciplines/science, humanities, social thought, public health, architecture, even theology—can collaborate, debate, and learn from one another. We're seeing grassroots research networks, community-led academic journals, language preservation collectives, and independent creators gain traction in ways we haven’t seen before.

We’re heading into a world where a student in the Middle East can build something that rivals a startup in San Francisco. Where local stories can travel globally with the help of AI. Where learning, building, and contributing no longer require permission from gatekeepers.

This is what matters most. AI isn’t just about speed or automation. It’s about redistributing access to thought, creation, and opportunity. It’s rebalancing who gets to ask the questions—and who gets to shape the answers.

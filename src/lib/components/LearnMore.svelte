    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <p class="text-lg font-light text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-14">
      Hi, I'm Enes â€” a final-year Computer Science student at York University, originally from Turkey.
      I'm passionate about software development, and in my free time, I enjoy following football (I mean, soccer ðŸ˜„) and reading history.
      What makes me unique is my ability to adapt quickly to new environments. 
      Growing up, I moved between cities and countries, and this has shaped my resilience and flexibility â€” something I carry into both life and work.
